# Crud operation

To develop your CRUD operation website, create a Django project and app. Here's a roadmap:

Frontend:

Use HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to design the signup and login forms.
Use jQuery for dynamic interactions (e.g., form validation).
Backend:

Use Django to manage the project and create models for user data.
Implement signup/login functionalities with Djangoâ€™s built-in authentication.
Database:

Configure MySQL to store user details and CRUD data.
CRUD Operations:

Allow users to create, read, update, and delete records once logged in.
